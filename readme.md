Butanol models

This repository contains files for four models which have the RMG model (ending in `_no_isotope`) and the corresponding isotope version (ending in `_isotope`) for various for both n-butane (containing `_butane_`) and isobutane (containing `_ibutane_`). Each model has a chemkin file, with RMG-generated comments (starting with `chem_annotated`) and a file describing the bonding of each species (starting with `species_dictionary`). These models can be opened with CHEMKIN, CANTERA, or RMG.

For examples of analyzing the isotope model to get experimental information, checkout the zenodo repository with DOI [10.5281/zenodo.2567585](dx/doi/10.5281/zenodo.2567585).
